<h3><font face ="MV Boli"><u> Introduction</u></h3>
<p>
<font face="ARIAL">
Maharishi Vidya Mandir, Guwahati like all other Maharishi Institutions is established to introduce Maharishiji's Consciousness Based Education System in
mainstream school education to its students. This system (MCBE) has been tried, implemented successfully and is repeatedly verified by over 700 scientific
research studies conducted in 215 universities and independent research institutions of 35 countries. These studies have been published in 6 volumes and
have documented the remarkable benefits of Consciousness Based Education e.g. greater use of intelligence, superior brain wave functioning, faster learning
ability, faster reaction time, coherent thought process, longer retention of knowledge, improved health and reversal of aging.
<p>
In the words of Maharishi Ji, 'the roots of modern day problems are the incomplete growth of human brain because of incomplete, fragmented education.
The education is incomplete when the student is not able to utilize or develop the creative brain potential, thereby allowing imbalances to creep in.
‘The dissatisfaction created by the failure is nothing but an outcome of cumulative stress and strain due to gross violation of the laws of Nature.
Thereby, it is essential to take the knowledge through education to pure consciousness level, where all the laws of Nature are aligned. This facilitates
every student to adhere to the Laws of Nature and to realise an ideal and successful environment’.
<p>
To fulfill this aim, Maharishi Vidya Mandir schools are establishing the value of pure consciousness in all the students across the country, thereby not only
helping the students to acquire conventional knowledge for gaining professional skills but also for implementing their total knowledge of natural law in personal
life. This allows a student to lead a stress-free and strain free life to accomplish their desires without any difficulty. The aim is to allow each generation
to enjoy fruits of all knowledge and with its own accomplished life can enliven the whole world consciousness and play again the role of Jagat Guru.
